This project was created for an undergraduate data structures and algorithms course. The course required the creation of a hash table without using the built in python dictionary.
the click commands were created for evaluation purposes to allow an evaluator to look up information on specific packages.

the scenario was to creage an algorithm for a small package delivery company to deliver 40 packages with several constraints.

the following assumptions were allowed:

•  Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages.

•  Trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour.

•  Trucks have a “infinite amount of gas” with no need to stop.

•  Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.

•  Drivers leave the hub at 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed. 
The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.

•  Delivery time is instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery 
(that time is factored into the average speed of the trucks).

•  There is up to one special note for each package.

•  The wrong delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. The correct 
address is 410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111.

•  The package ID is unique; there are no collisions.

•  No further assumptions exist or are allowed.
